## Project Overview

This analysis examines the performance and trends of six agricultural categories produced in the United States, focusing on their historical progression and potential correlations. The impact of each state's production was also taken into account. The data spans the years 1990 to 2022.

The following sections outline the steps taken during the analysis, including SQL queries and visualizations. You can also explore the findings interactively through the dashboard linked [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yassmin.ac/viz/USDAAgriculturalAnalysis/Milkdashboard).
